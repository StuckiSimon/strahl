Real-time rendering has been widely adopted for the web over the past decade. Specific use cases such as industrial applications where products are highly customizable with a large degree of variability do not strictly require real-time rendering performance. Instead, they can benefit from the realism provided by path tracing without having to introduce the complexity of having pre-rendered images generated by an offline renderer. WebGPU is a new web standard that provides low-level access to the GPU, enabling high-performance graphics programming on the web. In combination with physically based rendering based on the OpenPBR standard. The result is an open-source path tracer to be used to render 3d scenes on the web.
