Rasterization has dominated real-time rendering on the web since the inception of WebGL in 2011. The approach has limitations when attempting to achieve advanced lighting effects such as realistic shadows. This necessitates more complex techniques, frequently requiring pregenerated artifacts to achieve desired visual fidelity. Path tracing inherently addresses these shortcomings, albeit with increased rendering time. Specific use cases such as industrial applications where products are highly customizable with a large degree of variability do not strictly require real-time rendering performance. Instead, they can benefit from the realism provided by path tracing without having to introduce the complexity of having pregenerated images generated by an offline renderer. This work explores the potential of WebGPU, to facilitate path tracing on the web. By integrating OpenPBR, a standard which is physically-based, realistic rendering is achieved. The result is an open-source path tracer to be used to render 3d scenes on the web which eliminates the need for pregenerated assets for industrial use cases.
