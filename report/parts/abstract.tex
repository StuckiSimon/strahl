Over the past decade, real-time rendering using rasterization has been widely adopted on the web. The approach induces additional complexity to obtain advanced rendering artifacts such as realistic shadow behavior. Approaches such as path tracing address these shortcomings, albeit with increased rendering time. Specific use cases such as industrial applications where products are highly customizable with a large degree of variability do not strictly require real-time rendering performance. Instead, they can benefit from the realism provided by path tracing without having to introduce the complexity of having pre-rendered images generated by an offline renderer. WebGPU is a new web standard that provides low-level access to the GPU, enabling high-performance graphics programming on the web. In combination with physically based rendering based on the OpenPBR standard. The result is an open-source path tracer to be used to render 3d scenes on the web.
