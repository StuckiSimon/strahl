This master thesis explores the use of WebGPU for developing a real-time ray tracer on the web. Ray tracing is a powerful computer graphics technique for rendering realistic images by simulating light transport. WebGPU is a new web standard that provides low-level access to the GPU, enabling high-performance graphics programming on the web.
The thesis focuses on techniques for real-time ray tracing, including geometry representation, acceleration structures, shading and rendering and provides an open-source implementation.
