This work presents a web-based, open-source path tracer for rendering physically-based 3D scenes. It leverages the capabilities of WebGPU and integrates the OpenPBR surface shading model. While rasterization has been the dominant real-time rendering technique on the web since the inception of WebGL in 2011, the approach has limitations when attempting to achieve advanced lighting effects such as realistic shadows and reflections. This necessitates more complex techniques, frequently relying on pregenerated artifacts to attain desired visual fidelity. Path tracing inherently addresses these weaknesses but at the cost of increased rendering times. This work focuses on specific use cases, such as industrial applications where highly customizable products with significant variability are commonplace. In these scenarios, real-time rendering performance is not a strict requirement. Conversely, the increased realism offered by path tracing can be beneficial, eliminating the need for pregenerated assets typically used with offline renderers. This work explores the potential of WebGPU to enable path tracing on the web, facilitating the integration of the OpenPBR standard for physically-based material representation. The final outcome is a near real-time, open-source path tracer that can render 3D scenes directly in a web browser.
