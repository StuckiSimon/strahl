This master thesis explores the use of WebGPU for developing a real-time ray tracer on the web. Ray tracing is a powerful technique for rendering realistic images by simulating light transport. WebGPU is a new web standard that provides low-level access to the GPU, enabling high-performance graphics programming on the web.

The goal of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility and performance of implementing a ray tracer using WebGPU. The thesis will cover the design and implementation of the algorithm.
