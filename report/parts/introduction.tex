Ray tracing is a powerful technique for rendering photorealistic sceneries. Historically, ray tracing has been mainly used in offline rendering due to its computational complexity. However, advancements in hardware and software have enabled real-time ray tracing in a variety of domains.
WebGPU is a new web standard that provides a robust API for leveraging the power of GPUs across different platforms. It's designed to be more efficient and flexible than its predecessor, WebGL. This makes it ideal to be used for real-time ray tracing in the browser.
