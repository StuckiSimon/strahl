`strahl` was written as part of a master thesis. Therefore, a detailed report is available. If you're unsure about whether this is interesting to you, there is a short paper which gives a brief introduction into the topic available on [ACM](https://doi.org/10.1145/3665318.3677158).

However, if you're interested in the full details and theoretical background, the full report is available on [Github](https://github.com/StuckiSimon/strahl).
