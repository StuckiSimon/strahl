# Environment Light

Environment light is defined as the contribution of sky and sun. Sky settings are direction independent and are akin to `AmbientLight`. Sun is direction-dependent.

## Configuration

To configure the settings, you may pass your own environment light configuration to `strahl`.

```js title="strahlConfiguration.js"
runPathTracer(target, model, {
  environmentLightConfiguration: {
    sky: {
      power: 0.5,
      color: [0.8, 0.8, 1.0],
    },
    sun: {
      power: 1.0,
      angularSize: 35,
      latitude: 40,
      longitude: 160,
      color: [1.0, 1.0, 0.9],
    },
  },
});
```

### Sun Configuration

Use `angularSize` to determine the size of the sun, `latitude` and `longitude` to change the position and therefore direction of light, `color` for different effects, and `power` for the intensity.

### Sky Configuration

Use `power` for intensity of ambient light and `color` for different effects.

    "skyPower",
    "skyColor",
