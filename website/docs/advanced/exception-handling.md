# Exception Handling

`strahl` provides parseable exceptions to help debugging failures in the program. For ease-of-use, the name of the exception is written in brackets (`[ExceptionName] â€¦`).

:::tip
Certain exceptions have more detailed information attached as properties, use `console.error("%O", e);` to log the exception object in full detail.
