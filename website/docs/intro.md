## Browser Support

Strahl is written in WebGPU. WebGPU is a new web API which is not yet supported in all browsers. Check [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/webgpu) for details about the support. To check if your current browser supports WebGPU, head over to [webgpureport.org](https://webgpureport.org/).

WebGPU is restricted to secure contexts. This includes `localhost`, but otherwise requires use of `HTTPS`. See [Secure Context on developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) for more information.
