# Getting Started

## Installation

The library is available in the npm registry. To install it using npm, run:

```
npm install --save strahl
```

## Setup

### Define canvas

```html title="index.html"
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas width="512" height="512" id="render-target"></canvas>
  </body>
</html>
```

:::warning
Make sure that the `canvas` is present in the `DOM` before calling `strahl`.
:::

### Prepare 3D data

Load 3D models using `three` loaders.

Make sure to assign `OpenPBRMaterial` to all materials within the scene.

### Initialize `strahl`

```js
await runPathTracer("render-target", model);
```
