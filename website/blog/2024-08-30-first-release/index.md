The first version of `strahl` â€” `0.1.0` â€” has just been released ðŸš€

<!-- truncate -->

This marks the finish of the active development as part of the master thesis.
The report of the thesis is available online â€” [report](https://github.com/StuckiSimon/strahl/blob/report/report.pdf).
However, the documentation is probably more interesting as it contains a variety of examples and interactive sandboxes to interact with the path tracer.

Feel free try it out! Even if the work is submitted, direct feedback and suggestions are very much welcome.
