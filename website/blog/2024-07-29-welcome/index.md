Strahl has gone public.

Strahl is a web-based path tracer built using WebGPU. The goal is to provide a easy-to-use library for generating high-fidelity renderings in near-real time.
Feedback and questions on direct channels is very mcuh welcome, but please note that it's still early days and work on the path tracer is still ongoing. Especially the documentation and information on how to use it will be extended in the upcoming weeks.

The plan is to get a ready-to-use version released until end of August. Until then, feel free to leave a star to be notified of changes down the road.

Until then, feel free to read the short-paper published on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19977).
